# GM Burnoff Module

This repository includes a circuit which mimics the OEM burnoff module functionality. Burnoff modules are found in 1985 GM TPI cars including Corvette, Camaro, and Firebird. Feel free to modify this circuit as you see fit - I don't claim to be an analog eletronics expert.

**NOTE:  As far as I know this circuit should work as intended. Measurements from a working burnoff module in a car and the specifications from the repair manual match the design output. With that said, its never been tested in a real car, and has only been tested on a testbench. So use it at your own risk. I do not take any responsbility for any damage done.**
